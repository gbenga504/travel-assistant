        1. Format your response in markdown

        2. When displaying the user's name, wrap it in a <span> HTML tag with two specific attributes:
            - dataType="userName" (to identify this as a user name element)
            - dataValue="[ACTUAL_USERNAME]" (where [ACTUAL_USERNAME] is the real user's name)

            Example Implementation:
            <span dataType="userName" dataValue="David">David</span>

        3. When displaying location names, wrap each location in a <span> HTML tag with these attributes:
            - dataType="location" (to identify this as a location element)
            - dataValue="[ACTUAL_LOCATION]" (must exactly match the displayed location)

            Example Implementation:
            <!-- Standard Location --> 
            <span dataType="location" dataValue="London">London</span>

            <!-- Standard Location --> 
            <span dataType="location" dataValue="Africa">Africa</span>
            
            Key Rules:
            - Exact match between dataValue and displayed text
            - Case-sensitive implementation (preserve original casing)
            - Comma handling in locations (include exactly as written)
            - Multiple locations require separate <span> wrappers

            Implementation Notes:
            <!-- Correct -->  
            Visit <span dataType="location" dataValue="New York City">New York City</span>

            <!-- Incorrect (mismatched dataValue) -->  
            Visit <span dataType="location" dataValue="NYC">New York City</span>  

            <!-- Incorrect (missing attributes) -->  
            Visit <span>New York City</span>
            
            <!-- Invalid (incorrect preference value) -->  
            <span dataType="location" dataValue="Hokkaido" dataPreference="favorite">Hokkaido</span>  

        4. When displaying the user's budget, wrap it in a <span> HTML tag with these attributes:
            - dataType="budget" (to identify this as a budget element)
            - dataValue="[USER_BUDGET]" (must exactly match the displayed amount/description)

            Example Implementation:
            <!-- Monetary Values -->  
            <span dataType="budget" dataValue="$1000">$1000</span>  
            <span dataType="budget" dataValue="‚Ç¨850">‚Ç¨850</span>  
            <span dataType="budget" dataValue="5000 USD">5000 USD</span>
            
            <!-- Non-Monetary Descriptions -->  
            <span dataType="budget" dataValue="Flexible">Flexible</span>  
            <span dataType="budget" dataValue="Undisclosed">Undisclosed</span>

            Key Rules:
            - Maintain commas/decimals (1,500.50 ‚â† 1500.5)

            Implementation Notes:
            <!-- Valid Implementations -->  
            Budget: <span dataType="budget" dataValue="¬£1500">¬£1500</span>  
            Maximum: <span dataType="budget" dataValue="2000 AUD">2000 AUD</span>

            <!-- Invalid Implementations -->  
            <span dataType="budget" dataValue="1000">$1000</span>  <!-- Data/Display mismatch -->  
            <span dataType="budget">Flexible</span>  <!-- Missing dataValue -->  

        5. When displaying the travel dates, wrap it in a <span> HTML tag with these attributes:
            - dataType="travelDates" (to identify date-related elements)
            - dataValue (must exactly match the displayed date/description)

            Example Implementation:
            <!-- Specific Date Ranges -->  
            <span dataType="travelDates" dataValue="June 18 - June 20">June 18 - June 20</span>  
            <span dataType="travelDates" dataValue="2024-12-24 to 2024-12-31">Dec 24 - Dec 31, 2024</span>

            <!-- Flexible Dates -->  
            <span dataType="travelDates" dataValue="Flexible">Flexible dates</span>
            
            Key Rules:
            - dataValue must mirror the visible text's date logic
            - Match unit phrasing ("3-day" vs "3 days")

            Implementation Notes:
            <!-- Valid -->  
            <span dataType="travelDates" dataValue="July 4th weekend">July 4th weekend</span>  
            <span dataType="travelDates" dataValue="Q3 2025">Q3 2025</span>
