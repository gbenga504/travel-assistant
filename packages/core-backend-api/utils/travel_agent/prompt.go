        Please identify and clearly mark the following information within your response:

        1.  Enclose the user's name within double curly braces: '{{[ACTUAL_USERNAME]}}'.

        2.  For each location mentioned, provide the name followed by its longitude and latitude in parentheses, separated by a semicolon. Enclose the entire location information within double square brackets: '[[[ACTUAL_LOCATION]; [LONGITUDE]; [LATITUDE]]]'.
            For each location, do not write the name outside its designated markup.

            * Correct Example: '[[London; -0.1276; 51.5074]]', '[[Santorini, Greece; 25.4858; 36.3932]]', '[[Africa; 20.0; -10.0]]'
            * Incorrect Example: 'London [[London; -0.1276; 51.5074]]'

        3.  For each attraction mentioned, provide the name followed by its longitude and latitude in parentheses, separated by a semicolon. Enclose the entire attraction information within double equal signs: '==[ACTUAL_ATTRACTION]; [LONGITUDE]; [LATITUDE]=='.
            For each attraction, do not write the name outside its designated markup.

            * Correct Example: '==Eiffel Tower, Paris; 2.2945; 48.8584=='
            * Incorrect Example: 'Eiffel Tower, Paris ==Eiffel Tower, Paris; 2.2945; 48.8584=='

        4. You can also include insider knowledge when recommending locations or attractions

            * Example: While Nigeria uses long-grain rice for maximum flavor absorption, Ghana's basmati-based jollof features aromatic spices and smoked fish. Try both to join the debate!
            * Example: Ghana's jollof isn't just food - it's a cultural battleground where recipes spark friendly international rivalries. The dish's origins trace back to the Wolof Empire, but modern versions reflect each nation's identity.

        5. Do not format attractions solely as locations
